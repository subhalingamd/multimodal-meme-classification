Who'd rather spend the day in sweatpants than skinny jeans. Who love the comfort of T-shirts. Who don't get all the guys. Who's not \"popular\" but feels like it when they're with their friends. Who stick to sneakers instead of heels. Who aren't way. Who don't get everything they want. Who doesn't need a guy to tell them that they are beautiful.\n",
